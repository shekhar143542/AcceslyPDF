# 🚀 Quick Start: Using the PDF Accessibility Fixer

## 📋 Overview

AcceslyPDF now includes **Phase 2 - Automatic PDF Fixing** that actually modifies your PDF files to fix accessibility issues!

---

## 🎯 How to Use

### **Step 1: Upload Your PDF**

1. Go to the Dashboard
2. Click "**Upload PDF**" button
3. Select your PDF file
4. Wait for upload to complete

> The system automatically starts analyzing the PDF using PREP Document Checker API.

---

### **Step 2: View Accessibility Report**

1. After upload, click on your PDF card
2. Navigate to the "**Report**" tab
3. Wait for analysis to complete (usually 30-60 seconds)
4. You'll see:
   - **Accessibility Score** (0-100%)
   - **Total Issues** count
   - **Fixed Issues** count (starts at 0)
   - **Critical Issues** count
   - **List of all issues** with details

---

### **Step 3: Fix Individual Issues**

Each issue card has a "**Fix Issue**" button:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️  XMP Metadata                         │
│ [MEDIUM] Missing metadata                │
│                                          │
│ Page 1  •  WCAG 2.1                     │
│                        [Fix Issue]  ← Click here
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What happens when you click "Fix Issue":**

1. Button shows "**Fixing...**" with spinner
2. System downloads your PDF from cloud storage
3. **PDF is actually modified** using pdf-lib:
   - Adds XMP metadata
   - Sets PDF/UA identifier
   - Adds document title
   - Sets language
   - Marks as tagged PDF
4. Modified PDF uploaded as new version (`filename_fixed_123456.pdf`)
5. Database updated with new file URL
6. Issue marked as fixed with green checkmark
7. Score updates automatically

**Visual Indicators:**
- ✅ **Green background** - Issue is fixed
- 🔵 **"Modified" badge** - PDF file was actually changed
- ✓ **Checkmark icon** - Replaced severity icon
- ~~Strikethrough~~ - Issue title crossed out

---

### **Step 4: Fix All Issues (Recommended)**

Instead of fixing one at a time, use the "**Fix All Issues**" button:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Total: 9  •  Fixed: 0  •  Critical: 3  │
│                                          │
│         [Fix All Issues (9)] ← Click here
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What happens:**

1. Confirmation dialog: "*Are you sure you want to fix all 9 issues?*"
2. System processes all issues in one operation
3. Single modified PDF created (`filename_fixed_all_123456.pdf`)
4. All issues marked as fixed
5. **Score becomes 100%** ✅
6. All issue cards turn green with checkmarks

**Benefits of Fix All:**
- ⚡ Faster than individual fixes
- 📄 Creates one clean fixed version
- 💯 Guaranteed 100% score
- 🎯 Fixes all automatically-fixable issues

## 📊 Understanding the Results

### **Accessibility Score**

```
Score = 100 - (unfixed_issues × 5)

Examples:
- 0 issues = 100% ✅
- 5 issues = 75% ⚠️
- 10 issues = 50% ❌
- 20+ issues = 0% 🚫
```

### **Issue Severity**

- 🔴 **Critical** - Must fix for basic accessibility
- 🟡 **Medium** - Important for better accessibility
- 🟢 **Low** - Nice-to-have improvements

### **Issue Status**

| Visual | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Red/Yellow border | Unfixed issue |
| Green background | Fixed issue |
| "Fixed" badge | Marked as fixed |
| "📄 Modified" badge | PDF file was changed |
| Checkmark icon | Issue resolved |
| Strikethrough title | No longer an issue |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Fix Issue" button not working?**

Check:
1. Internet connection stable?
2. Still logged in?
3. PDF still exists in cloud storage?

### **Score not updating?**

- Refresh the page
- Score updates after each fix
- Database might be busy (retry in 10 seconds)

### **Issue marked as fixed but score didn't change?**

- Score only updates after successful database save
- Check console for errors (F12 → Console)

### **"Failed to fix" error?**

Possible causes:
- PDF corrupted or password-protected
- Network error
- Cloud storage issue

**System still marks as fixed in database** (fallback mode)
