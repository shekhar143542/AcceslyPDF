# Theme System Fixed - System Default + Consistent Score Colors

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Score Colors Changing with Theme ❌
**Problem:** When toggling dark/light mode, the PDF card percentage colors were changing (e.g., green → light green in dark mode)

**Solution:** Made score colors CONSISTENT across all themes ✅
- **Green (90%+)**: Always `#16a34a` (green-600) - Excellent scores
- **Yellow (70-89%)**: Always `#ca8a04` (yellow-600) - Good scores  
- **Red (0-69%)**: Always `#dc2626` (red-600) - Needs work scores

These colors stay the same regardless of light/dark mode!

### Issue 2: System Default Theme
**Updated:** App now respects system preference on first load
- If system is in dark mode → app starts in dark mode
- If system is in light mode → app starts in light mode
- User's manual selection is saved and takes precedence on subsequent visits

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/PDFCard.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Removed theme-dependent color changes for scores
- Created `getScoreColor()` function with fixed colors based on percentage
- Simplified badge styling with consistent colors
- Removed `statusConfig` complexity

**Before:**
```tsx
text-green-600 dark:text-green-400  // Changed with theme
```

**After:**
```tsx
text-green-600  // Always green, no theme variation
```

### 2. `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Improved system preference detection
- Better comments explaining behavior
- Maintains saved preference priority

**Logic:**
1. Check if user has saved preference → Use it
2. If not → Use system preference (dark/light)
3. Save user's choice when they toggle

### 3. `src/app/globals.css`
**Changes:**
- Added consistent score color classes
- Ensured proper theme transitions
- Fixed light mode white backgrounds
- Added CSS custom properties for theme colors

**New Classes:**
```css
.score-excellent { color: #16a34a !important; }
.score-good { color: #ca8a04 !important; }
.score-poor { color: #dc2626 !important; }
```

## 🎨 Design Principles Applied

1. **Semantic Colors:** Score colors have meaning (green=good, red=bad) regardless of theme
2. **Consistency:** Important metrics don't change appearance with theme
3. **Accessibility:** High contrast maintained in both themes
4. **User Preference:** System default respected, manual choice saved
5. **Full Coverage:** When theme toggles, EVERYTHING changes appropriately

## 💡 Why This Approach?

### Score Colors Stay Consistent Because:
- **Psychological association:** Green = good, red = bad (universal)
- **At-a-glance scanning:** Users can quickly identify problem PDFs
- **Color blindness:** Consistent colors help users with color vision deficiencies
- **Professional appearance:** Serious data visualization keeps consistent color coding

### What Changes with Theme:
- **Reading comfort:** Light mode for bright environments, dark for low light
- **Aesthetic preference:** Some users prefer dark interfaces
- **System integration:** Matches user's OS appearance preference
