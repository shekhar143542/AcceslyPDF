# PDF.js Worker Setup Guide

## ✅ Problem Fixed

The error **"Setting up fake worker failed: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module"** has been resolved.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. **Local Worker File**
- PDF.js worker is now served from the `/public` directory
- Worker file: `public/pdf.worker.min.mjs`
- No CDN dependency (works offline and in production)

### 2. **Automatic Copy Script**
Created `scripts/copy-pdf-worker.js` that:
- Copies worker from `node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs`
- Places it in `public/pdf.worker.min.mjs`
- Runs automatically on `npm install` (postinstall hook)
- Runs before `npm run build` (prebuild step)

### 3. **Worker Configuration**
```typescript
// In PDFViewer.tsx
pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.min.mjs';
```

### 4. **Next.js Configuration**
Updated `next.config.ts` to handle PDF.js webpack issues:
```typescript
webpack: (config) => {
  config.resolve.alias.canvas = false;
  config.resolve.alias.encoding = false;
  return config;
}
```

## 📦 Updated Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
    "build": "node scripts/copy-pdf-worker.js && next build --turbopack",
    "postinstall": "node scripts/copy-pdf-worker.js"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Development
1. Run `npm install` → Worker is automatically copied
2. Run `npm run dev` → Worker is available at `/pdf.worker.min.mjs`
3. PDF.js loads the worker from local public directory

### Production (Vercel)
1. `npm install` runs → Worker copied via postinstall hook
2. `npm run build` runs → Ensures worker is present before build
3. Worker is included in static files
4. PDF.js loads from `/pdf.worker.min.mjs` route

## ✅ Benefits

1. **No CDN Dependency** - Works offline and with restrictive CSP policies
2. **Faster Loading** - Worker served from same domain (no CORS)
3. **Version Matching** - Worker version always matches pdfjs-dist version
4. **Build-Time Safety** - Worker copied automatically, no manual steps
5. **Vercel Compatible** - Works perfectly in production deployments

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Restart your dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to any PDF viewer page
# Open browser console - should see:
# ✅ PDF.js worker configured from /pdf.worker.min.mjs
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Test PDF viewing - should work without errors
```

## 🔍 Verification

Check these things to ensure it's working:

1. **Worker File Exists**
   - Check `public/pdf.worker.min.mjs` exists
   - File size should be ~1.7 MB

2. **No Console Errors**
   - Open browser DevTools Console
   - Should NOT see "Setting up fake worker failed"
   - Should see "✅ PDF.js worker configured"

3. **PDF Renders**
   - PDFs should load and display all pages
   - No errors in Network tab
   - Worker loads from `/pdf.worker.min.mjs` (check Network tab)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Worker File Missing
```bash
# Manually copy worker
node scripts/copy-pdf-worker.js
```

### Still Getting Errors
1. Delete `.next` folder: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules; npm install`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### Vercel Deployment Issues
- Ensure `scripts/copy-pdf-worker.js` is committed to Git
- Check Vercel build logs for "✅ PDF.js worker copied"
- Verify `/pdf.worker.min.mjs` is accessible in production

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **src/components/PDFViewer.tsx**
   - Changed worker source to `/pdf.worker.min.mjs`

2. **next.config.ts**
   - Added webpack configuration for PDF.js

3. **package.json**
   - Added postinstall and build scripts

4. **scripts/copy-pdf-worker.js** (NEW)
   - Automated worker copy script

5. **public/pdf.worker.min.mjs** (NEW)
   - PDF.js worker file (auto-generated)

## 🎉 Result

✅ PDF viewer now works without worker errors
✅ Compatible with Next.js SSR and client-side rendering
✅ Works in development and production
✅ No external CDN dependencies
✅ Automatic setup on npm install
